   <!-- The Sisters of Jesus the Saviour is a young growing religious Congregation,
    which was founded by Rev. Fr. Prof. Emmanuel Matthew Paul Edeh C.S.Sp 
    in the year 1985 in Port Harcourt Diocese. The Sisters of Jesus the Saviour Congregation, 
    otherwise known as, the Saviour Sisters (SJS) are based in Elele in the South-East of Nigeria.
     The Congregation was founded for a particular need and purpose in the life of the Church.
      Our Founder had his inspiration through our Lord's special mission to the sick and suffering people,
       together with Christ's suffering in the cross. Our father founder always felt compassion
        for the sick and suffering people of God. He loves to stay with them to relieve their suffering, 
        thus he scarcely had time for himself. These people, the sick, the mentally deranged, 
        the less privileged and abandoned always gather around him to be helped. As they increased
         rapidly, he saw the need for helpers. Thus he decided to found a Congregation of the Sisters 
         to live and work in the midst of these sick and suffering people, the abjectly poor and abandoned,
          so that the sisters could understand them, feel with them and manifest the charism of the founder
           in a profound manner. The sisters in humility try to portray the compassionate Jesus in their 
           actions. They profess the three evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity and obedience.
            The first intakes of this Congregation (26 in number) were screened and trained
             by the Sisters of Immaculate Heart of Mary Congregation (IHM), with Sr. John Bechmans Ibekwe 
             (IHM) as the first Novice Mistress assisted by four others. After the meticulous Postulancy
              period, followed by protracted and well organized Novitiate formation, the thirteen pioneer
               members of this young Congregation made their first religious profession on January 10th 1990.
                From then till now the Congregation has been having temporal and final professions
                 yearly without any gap. The charism of the Congregation is Perpetual Adoration
                  of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament and caring with compassion. The apostolate
                   apart from sanctification of its members involves. -->
